# 6502 emulator

I am restarting the 6502 emulator because honestly I think I could do better after what I learned starting the previous one. I also just got bored of the last one so I kinda forgot how the codebase worked and I want to make it more readable.

## OS Support

Only supporting Linux for now because this is meant to be so I can learn C. *not anymore I was just writing C++ in C, and realized whenever I was making structs of function pointers for each struct so I just decided to make my life easier*.

## TODO
- Write the headers so that things are "theoretically" functional
- Maybe migrate the logging library to c++ if I feel like it
