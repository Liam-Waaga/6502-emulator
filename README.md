# 6502 emulator

I am restarting the 6502 emulator because honestly I think I could do better after what I learned starting the previous one. I also just got bored of the last one so I kinda forgot how the codebase worked and I want to make it more readable.

## OS Support

Only supporting Linux for now because this is meant to be so I can learn C.
