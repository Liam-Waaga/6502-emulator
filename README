# 6502 Emulator written in C, designed to be modular.
Doesn't support windows, becuase windows programming is paingful, and I don't use windows so I don't care

# NOTES
- Most of the code has never been run, but it compiles (on linux). Only code actually tested is the log functions
- When writing new devices, add options to parser(.h/.c) (add to device struct)
- Config is probably not standard compliant ini, if there even is a standard I didn't read it.

# Example
