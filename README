# 6502 Emulator written in C, designed to be modular.
Doesn't support windows, becuase windows programming is paingful, and I don't use windows so I don't care

# NOTES
- Most of the code has never been run, but it compiles (on linux). Only code actually tested is the log functions
- When writing new devices, add options to parser(.h/.c) (add to device struct)
- Config is probably not standard compliant ini, if there is a standard I didn't read it.
- I skipped implementing some instructions, here is a list
- - BRK

# TODO
- Add opcodes of implemented instructions to switch statement
- Implement extended waits (ex, +1 clock if page crossed, +1 if branch, etc)
- Add undocumented opcodes

# Example
