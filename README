# 6502 Emulator written in C, designed to be modular.
Doesn't support windows, becuase windows programming is paingful, and I don't use windows so I don't care

# NOTES
- Most of the code has never been run, but it compiles (on linux). Only code actually tested is the log functions

# TODO
- Implement vm_(read/write)_(byte/word)
