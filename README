# 6502 Emulator written in C, designed to be modular.
Doesn't support windows, becuase windows programming is paingful, and I don't use windows so I don't care

# NOTES
- Most of the code has never been run, but it compiles (on linux). Only code actually tested is the log functions
- When writing new devices, add options to parser(.h/.c) (add to device struct)


Example config file
I know it looks like toml, but its only kind of, and definitely doesn't have all the features of toml

```fake toml
[system]
clock_speed = 1000000
loglevel = 0 # 0 = error, 1 = warn, 2 = info

[ram]
# todo, finish example
```
