# 6502 Emulator written in C, designed to be modular.

# NOTES
Not finished, many instructions are not supported and many devices are not supported yet (ex, arduino lcd, full display, serial input, etc).

# TODO
- Add opcodes of implemented instructions to switch statement
- Implement extended waits (ex, +1 clock if page crossed, +1 if branch, etc)
- Finish implementing main opcodes
- Add undocumented opcodes
- Process command line args well
- I skipped implementing some instructions, here is a list
- - BRK
